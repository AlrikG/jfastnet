Designed for games.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nThe following code shows the important parts of a server-client communication:\r\n```java\r\nServer server = new Server(new Config().setBindPort(15150));\r\nClient client = new Client(new Config().setPort(15150));\r\n\r\nserver.start();\r\nclient.start();\r\nclient.blockingWaitUntilConnected();\r\n\r\nserver.send(new PrintMessage(\"Hello Client!\"));\r\nclient.send(new PrintMessage(\"Hello Server!\"));\r\n```\r\n[Click to see full sample code of HelloWorld.java](./src/test/java/com/jfastnet/examples/HelloWorld.java)\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\nThe documentation is still a work-in-progress.\r\n\r\nThe most important classes to look for in the beginning are the `Config` and the `Message` class. The JavaDoc there should provide you with the basic configuration possibilities of the library.\r\n\r\n## Reliable sending\r\nThere are currently two ways you can use to send a message in a reliable way. Sending the message unreliably is of course also an option.\r\n\r\n1. Acknowledge packet\r\n2. Sequence number\r\n\r\n### Acknowledge packet\r\nThe receiver of a message with reliable mode set to `ACK_PACKET` will send an acknowledge packet to the other end upon receipt of the message.\r\nAs long as the sender of the prior mentioned message doesn't receive an acknowledge packet it will keep resending the message.\r\n\r\n Attribute | Value\r\n --------- |:---:\r\n Reliable  | yes\r\n Ordered   | no\r\n\r\n### Sequence number\r\nThe receiver of a message with reliable mode set to `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` will do nothing as long as the messages arrive in the expected order.\r\nBut if a message with an id greater than expected is received, the receiver will stop processing the messages and send a `RequestSeqIdsMessage` to the other end.\r\nProcessing will not continue until all required messages are received.\r\n\r\n Attribute | Value\r\n --------- |:---:\r\n Reliable  | yes\r\n Ordered   | yes\r\n\r\nIt's usually advisable to use sequence numbers, as there will be less overhead and also the ordered delivery is guaranteed.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38988195-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
